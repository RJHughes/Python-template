# Python-template
A template repository for a Python project

This project uses a simple requirements.txt file for managing dependencies. To set up this project you will need pip. 
So as not to clutter your base Python installation with packages, you'll likely want to create a virtualenv for this 
project. 

[Here's how to do that in PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html)

[Here's how to do that using the command line](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/)

Once you have a virtual environment set up for this project you can get the dependecies from the requirements.txt file 
included in this repository.

Install the packages through PyCharm or by running

`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

In your virtual environment console
